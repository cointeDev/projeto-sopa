# src/services

The `src/services` directory contains modules responsible for handling data operations and integrations with external systems.

Services typically encapsulate business logic related to data retrieval, API communication, or interaction with backend resources.

Currently, this directory includes service functions used throughout the application to fetch, update, or process data in a consistent and reusable way.
