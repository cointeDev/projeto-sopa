# src/common/types

The `common/types` directory contains reusable type definitions shared across the entire application.

Currently, the directory contains a `types.ts` file with two exported types:

* One for function components (`FunctionComponentType`).
* Another for Heroicons (`HeroiconsType`).

These types are essential for ensuring consistency and proper typing throughout the codebase.
