# src/common/utils

The `common/utils` directory contains utility functions that are shared across the entire application.

Currently, the directory includes helper functions that abstract common logic and operations used in multiple places of the codebase.

These utilities help keep the code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and improve maintainability by centralizing shared logic.
